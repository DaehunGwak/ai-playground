       "'Here is the recipe for Coq au Vin (classic French stew):\\n\\n**Coq au Vin (Classic French Beef Stew)**\\n\\n**Prep time:** 15 minutes\\n**Cook time:** 1-1.5 hours\\n\\n**Yields:** 4-6 servings\\n\\n**Ingredients:**\\n\\n1. 1 whole chicken (about 3.5-4 lbs / 1.6-1.8 kg), cut into pieces\\n2. 2-3 tablespoons unsalted butter\\n3. 2-3 tablespoons olive oil\\n4. 1 large onion, chopped\\n5. 2 cloves garlic, minced\\n6. 1 shallot, thinly sliced (optional, adds sweetness)\\n7. 2-3 stalks celery, chopped\\n8. 2-3 carrots, chopped\\n9. 2 sprigs fresh thyme (or 1 teaspoon dried)\\n10. 1 bay leaf\\n11. 1 bottle dry red wine (like Burgundy, Pinot Noir, or Cabernet Sauvignon), about 750ml\\n12. 2-3 large cloves garlic, minced (for the wine)\\n13. 28-32 oz / 800-950g can crushed tomatoes or tomato puree/sauce\\n14. 2-3 tablespoons all-purpose flour (optional, for thickening)\\n15. Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste\\n16. 1-2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)\\n17. Lemon wedges (optional, for serving)\\n\\n**Equipment:**\\n\\n*   Large heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven\\n*   Large skillet (for searing the chicken)\\n*   Wooden spoon or heatproof silicone spatula\\n*   Ladle or slotted spoon\\n\\n**Instructions:**\\n\\n1.  **Prepare the Chicken:** Pat the chicken pieces dry with paper towels. Season generously with salt and pepper.\\n2.  **Sear the Chicken:** Heat the skillet over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil and half the butter. Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper. Sear the chicken pieces skin-side down until golden brown, about 6-8 minutes per side. Remove the chicken pieces from the skillet and set aside.\\n3.  **Sauté Aromatics:** Add the remaining butter to the hot skillet. Once melted, add the chopped onion, shallot (if using), and celery. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened. Add the chopped carrots and cook for another 3-4 minutes.\\n4.  **Deglaze the Pan:** Pour the red wine into the skillet, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to lift any browned bits from the chicken and vegetables. Let the wine bubble and reduce for a minute or two.\\n5.  **Add Tomato Sauce:** Stir in the crushed tomatoes (or tomato puree/sauce) and the minced garlic for the wine. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook for a few minutes until it slightly thickens.\\n6.  **Add Chicken and Herbs:** Return the seared chicken pieces to the skillet. Add the chopped carrots, thyme sprigs, and bay leaf. Pour in enough chicken stock (if using) or water to just cover the chicken and vegetables (about 1-2 inches / 2.5-5 cm). If using stock, stir it in; if using water, you can add it gradually until covered.\\n7.  **Simmer:** Cover the pot and place it in a preheated oven at 300°F (150°C) for about 1.5-2 hours, or simmer gently on the stovetop over medium-low heat for 1-1.2 hours. The chicken should be tender and easily pull away from the bone. If the liquid reduces too much and the chicken starts to stick, you can uncover and stir briefly, or add a little more chicken stock/water.\\n8.  **Thicken the Sauce (Optional):** If you prefer a thicker sauce, you can remove the lid and simmer uncovered for 15-20 minutes to reduce the liquid further. You can also make a slurry by whisking 2 tablespoons of flour with 2 tablespoons of cold water, then whisking it into the stew for the last 5 minutes of cooking.\\n9.  **Rest and Serve:** Remove the pot from the oven or heat source. Let the stew rest for at least 10-15 minutes before removing the chicken pieces. This allows the juices to redistribute.\\n10. **Serve:** Ladle the hot Coq au Vin stew into serving bowls. Garnish with fresh parsley and a squeeze of lemon juice (optional) and/or serve with lemon wedges. You can serve the chicken pieces whole or remove them and serve the meat over rice, mashed potatoes, or crusty bread. The leftover broth and vegetables are delicious too!'"
